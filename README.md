Major: Statistical Data Science
Minor: Math
Fun Fact: I have a golden doodle
Experience: I have very little experience in data science, I just did one project in which I predicted an NBA players points. 

Quote: To me the main thing in this quote that is interesting is how we underestimate the complexity of problems. I realized this in the project that I did, I ended up dumbing it down a lot more than I should have.
